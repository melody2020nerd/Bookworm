# Bookworm

Bookly is an online book store that provides books to users at a very low price. We have put this website together to also provide a means for users to earn money by buying to read, or buying to resell, or selling their used books. The purpose is to help reduce waste in the continent and the world at large as this books are recycled since they will now have new owners. We have also come up with the idea that any book that have been used for over five years will be provided to interested readers for free. We aim to promote reading culture by using this website for the purpose we have intended it for.
